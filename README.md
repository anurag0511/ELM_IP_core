# ELM_IP_core

This repo contains the verilog code for a custom random projection network known as the ![Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_learning_machine). This IP was designed using Verilog HDL and used the Vivado software for the synthesis and simulations. The device used was Nexsy 4 DDR which uses Xilinx artix7 FPGA fabric.

# ELM_IP_core

This repo contains the verilog code for a custom random projection network known as the [Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_learning_machine). This IP was designed using Verilog HDL and used the Vivado software for the synthesis and simulations. The device used was (XC7VX690T) using Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA fabric.
The corresponding details can be found in the paper titled : [Scalable IP Core for Feed Forward Random Networks](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23307-5_28)
